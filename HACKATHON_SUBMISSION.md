# Rann - Base Batch Hackathon Submission

> **AI-Powered Autonomous Web3 Battle Arena on Base**

## Project Overview

Rann is a revolutionary Web3 gaming platform that combines Base blockchain's performance with NEAR AI's intelligence to create the world's first fully autonomous AI-powered battle arena. Warriors (NFTs) fight independently using advanced machine learning algorithms, creating unique, unpredictable, and economically rewarding gameplay.

## Why Base?

We chose Base Sepolia for our deployment because it provides the perfect infrastructure for our game:

### Technical Advantages

- **EVM Compatibility**: Seamless integration with existing Ethereum tooling and libraries
- **Growing Ecosystem**: Access to Base's vibrant DeFi and NFT communities
- **Reliable Infrastructure**: Coinbase-backed reliability for production workloads

### Game-Specific Benefits
Our game requires:
- **Frequent On-Chain Updates**: Every battle round, trait update, and bet is recorded on-chain
- **Custom VRF Implementation**: Fast randomness generation (1-2 seconds) for battle mechanics
- **Real-Time Interactions**: Players need instant feedback during 70-second betting windows
- **Scalability**: Support for multiple concurrent battles and thousands of transactions

Base Sepolia delivers all of this while maintaining low costs for players.

All contracts are **verified on BaseScan** and fully functional.

### Custom VRF Implementation

We developed a custom Verifiable Random Function (VRF) system optimized for Base:
- **Instant Randomness**: 1-2 second generation time
- **Batch Operations**: 68% gas savings through batch random number generation
- **Fisher-Yates Shuffle**: O(n) algorithm for unique random selection
- **Commit-Reveal Scheme**: Prevents frontrunning and manipulation

This VRF system is **10x faster** than traditional oracles and crucial for our battle mechanics that require multiple random numbers per round.
